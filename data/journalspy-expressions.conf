# Example Journal Spy configuration
#
# Each match pattern has the following form (note the mandatory semicolon that
# marks beginning of a pattern):
#
# ;pattern-name
# JOURNAL_FIELD1=regexp1
# JOURNAL_FIELD2=regexp2
#
# Fields of each journal entry are matched against their respective regular
# expressions and if all of them match, a telemetry submission bearing a name
# 'JournalSpy-pattern-name' is created.
#
# Only alphanumeric characters, underscore (_) and hyphen (-) are allowed in
# a pattern name. 
#
# For all possible journal entry fields a pattern can inspect, look at a journal
# dump in the export format using 'journalctl -o export'.
